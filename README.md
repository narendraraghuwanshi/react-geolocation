# ðŸš´ Live Bike Tracking App (React + Leaflet)

This app provides real-time bike tracking on a map between two user-selected locations, with a modern UI and live route following.

### Features
- **Live Bike Tracking:**
  - Click "Show Live" after searching start and end locations to fetch a real route from GraphHopper and animate the bike along it.
  - The map zooms in and follows the bike as it moves.
  - Only one bike marker is shown at all times.
- **Location Search:**
  - Start and end locations are searched using Nominatim with autocomplete suggestions.
- **Route Display:**
  - The actual route coordinates are fetched from GraphHopper Directions API.
  - A right-side panel lists all route coordinates, highlighting the current bike position.
- **Modern UI:**
  - Clean layout with a map and a side panel for route details.
  - Responsive and visually appealing.
- **GitHub Ribbon:**
  - A GitHub ribbon at the top links directly to the repository code.

### Setup & Usage
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. **Get a GraphHopper API key:**
